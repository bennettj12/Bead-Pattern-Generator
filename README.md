# How to use

### Creating a palette
First, you should create a palette. Generally, it should be made up of the same colors that you have beads for, but you can use any colors.

In the Palettes tab, press "New Palette" and give it a name.

From here, set your new palette as the active palette by clicking on it. Now you can use the color picker to select colors, and add them to the palette by clicking "Add Selected Color".
You can paste color hex codes into the color picker.

Here is a link to a spreadsheet which contains hex codes for many different colors of beads:

Once you have added your desired colors to the palette, you can return to the "Create Palette" tab.

### Creating your grid

Now that you have a palette, you can press the browse button to find the image you wish to create a grid from. You should see the image load in the app.

Now you can set your width and height, or the number of beads horizontally and vertically. These numbers should follow the same aspect ratio as your source image, or else the image will be stretched.

Additionally, select your palette from the dropdown.

Clicking "Preview Grid" will show you what the image will look like palette swapped and downsampled to your settings:

### Generating the image

With everything else completed, 
you can press "Export" and select a filename and location for your export. An image like this one should be generated:
